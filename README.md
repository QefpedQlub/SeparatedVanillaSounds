# Separated Vanilla Sounds  

In its simplest form, this **resource pack** only adds more sound events for each **Vanilla** sound.  
Some sounds have slight modifications but should still be consistent with the game.  

Names are based on path directories to the  sound files.  
(E.g. The **Ancestry** track is located in `music/game`, so the new event is called `music.game.ancestry`)  

Unlike similar **resource packs**, .ogg files are not included:  
1. To avoid copyright infringement with [**Daniel "C418" Rosenfeld**](https://twitter.com/C418), [**Lena Raine**](https://twitter.com/kuraine), [**Samuel Ã…berg**](https://twitter.com/slamp0000), and others.  
2. To minimize the file size.
