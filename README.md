# Separate Vanilla Sounds  

In its simplest form, this **resource pack** only adds more sound events for each **Vanilla** sound.  
They still have their subtitles and play how they normally sound from using the **Vanilla** sound events.  

The names are based on directory paths to their respective sound files.  
(E.g. The **Ancestry** track is located in `music/game`, so the new event is called `music.game.ancestry`)

I'm uncertain whether this has already been done before, but let me know otherwise and I may take this down...
