# Separate Vanilla Sounds  

In its simplest form, this **resource pack** only adds more sound events for each **Vanilla** sound.  
They still have their subtitles and play how they normally sound from using the **Vanilla** sound events.  

The names are based on directory paths to their respective sound files.  
(E.g. The **Ancestry** track is located in `music/game`, so the new event is called `music.game.ancestry`)

Unlike other similar **resource packs**, it doesn't include the actual sound files:  

1. To avoid copyright infringement (with [**Daniel "C418" Rosenfeld**](https://twitter.com/C418), [**Lena Raine**](https://twitter.com/kuraine), [**Samuel Ã…berg**](https://twitter.com/slamp0000), and others).
2. To minimize the file size.
